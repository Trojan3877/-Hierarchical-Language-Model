# 📊 Project Status - Hierarchical Language Model (HLM)

## 🚀 Current Status
- **Version:** v1.0.0
- **Development Stage:** Capstone-ready ✅
- **Health:** Active, stable foundation with room for extensions
- **Last Updated:** August 27, 2025

---

## 🟢 What Works
- Sentence → Paragraph → Document hierarchical encoders
- Training & evaluation pipelines
- FastAPI inference API
- Streamlit dashboard for results
- Unit tests (pytest) with CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Config management via YAML
- Docker + Helm deployment readiness
- Logging + MLflow experiment tracking
- Data ingestion/preprocessing
- Jupyter notebook for exploration

---

## 🟡 Known Limitations
- Currently trained only on **demo/small datasets** (no large-scale training yet)
- Limited to **classification tasks** (summarization & QA planned in roadmap)
- Requires GPU for realistic performance; CPU works for testing only
- Dashboard metrics are placeholders until trained models are logged

---

## 🔮 Planned Improvements
- Fine-tuning with Hugging Face datasets
- Real-time metric visualization in Streamlit
- Multi-task extensions (classification, summarization, QA)
- Cloud deployment demo (AWS/GCP)
- Model optimization: quantization, pruning
