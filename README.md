# -Hierarchical-Language-Model
This project implements a **Hierarchical Language Model (HLM)** that processes text at multiple levels of granularity.   The system uses sentence-level, paragraph-level, and document-level encoders to capture local and global context, producing richer representations for natural language tasks.
